Google Tech Talks (online in Youtube) contain some really interesting material. The Closing Keynote for the 2011 edition was made by Steve McConnell, author of the reference books __Code Complete__ and __Rapid Development__ (some of the few books a self-appointed professional developer should have read).

In his speech titled "Secrets of World Class Software Organisations", Steve McConnell presents some key features of some of the most important software organisations in the world, including Microsoft, Google, NASA, etc. and relates them with some of the measurable factors that influence most a software organisation as it achieves a considerable size.

In short, a video worth viewing, if you have a free hour. Enjoy!
