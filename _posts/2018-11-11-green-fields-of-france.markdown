## The Green Fields Of France
(originally by Eric Bogle)

Oh how do you do, young Willy McBride<br>
Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside<br>
And rest for a while in the warm summer sun<br>
I've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done<br>
And I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen<br>
When you joined the great fallen in 1916<br>
Well I hope you died quick<br>
And I hope you died clean<br>
Or Willy McBride, was it slow and obscene<br>

Did they beat the drums slowly<br>
Did they play the fife lowly<br>
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down<br>
Did the band play the last post and chorus<br>
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest<br>

And I can't help but wonder oh Willy McBride<br>
Do all those who lie here know why they died<br>
Did you really believe them when they told you the cause<br>
Did you really believe that this war would end wars<br>
Well the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame<br>
The killing and dying it was all done in vain<br>
Oh Willy McBride it all happened again<br>
And again, and again, and again, and again<br>

Did they beat the drums slowly<br>
Did they play the fife lowly<br>
Did they sound the death march as they lowered you down<br>
Did the band play the last post and chorus<br>
Did the pipes play the flowers of the forest<br>
